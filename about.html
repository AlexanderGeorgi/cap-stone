        <h1>Game Modes</h1>
        <h3>Battle royal</h3>
        <p>Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in
        a squad usually consisting of three or four players.</p>

        <h3>Reload</h3>
        <p>Fortnite Reload is a fast-paced 40-player Battle Royale mode where eliminated players can respawn automatically as long
        as at least one teammate is still alive. When a player is eliminated, a reboot timer starts, which can be shortened by
        teammates reducing the timer through eliminations or knockdowns.</p>

        <h3>Fortnite ballistic</h3>
        <p>Ballistic is a separate game that you can choose via the Fortnite main menu. Teams of five are set as either Attackers
        or Defenders. Attackers attempt to plant the Rift Point Device at specific points on the map and then defend it long
        enough for it to detonate.</p>
        
        <h3>Fortnite festival</h3>
        <p>Fortnite Festival Battle Stage is a PvP mode where players compete against each other across a four-song set list. The
        last one standing wins. Public Battle Stage matches start with 16 players. In Private matches, you can play Battle Stage
        with your own setlist and party of up to four.</p>

        <h3>Fortnite Rocket Racing</h3>
        <p>Fortnite Rocket Racing is an arcade-style, rocket-powered car racing game mode within Fortnite, developed in
        collaboration with Psyonix, the creators of Rocket League. It features up to 12 players racing on gravity-defying
        tracks, focusing on skill, drifting for boost, and avoiding hazards instead of using weapons.</p>

        <h3>Blitz Royale</h3>
        <p>Fortnite Blitz Royale is a fast-paced, limited-time Battle Royale mode on a mini-map where 32 players start with a
        Medallion and a choice of gear, aiming to be the last team standing within a rapid five-minute round. Matches feature
        rapidly closing storm circles and a "Blitz Level" progression system, where eliminating opponents and surviving the
        storm earns power-ups and better gear. The mode offers a quicker, more intense experience than standard Battle Royale,
        with content like maps, weapons, and power-ups updated on a weekly basis.</p>
